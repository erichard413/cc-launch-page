                The Access Card can be used wherever VISA debit cards are
                accepted, around the world. It works just like any other prepaid
                card. This includes grocery stores, the mall, gas stations,
                restaurants, and more.

                Sometimes, cash is just easier. No problem. Cardholders can
                withdraw cash at ATM machines that carry the Cirrus or Pulse
                acceptance marks, anywhere around the globe. Cardholders should
                read the Cardholder Agreement sent with the card to understand
                any fees that may apply. The owner of the ATM machine may also
                charge a fee, and that will be disclosed on the screen during
                the transaction. Cardholders can also visit participating
                financial institutions and request a cash advance from a bank
                teller.
